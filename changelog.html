                        <strong>HUD:</strong> Removed Vanilla HUD Cleaned (As the name suggests, the improvements are mainly for the vanilla HUD style and therefore do not apply much to Darn).<br>
                        <strong>Content:</strong> Exchanged Uncut Wasteland for my own custom build of it made specifically for the guide.<br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Exchanged Different Pip-Boy Animations with Faster Pip-Boy Animation.

                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Replaced Altitude with DN Weathers (Visual mods are completely subjective so this may make some people upset.

                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Economy Overhaul (IMO the economy will be busted no matter what and you will always have plenty of caps, so making everything cheaper doesn't really work).<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed GRA Relocated (Related to above, weapons being on vendors gives the player to spend their plentiful amount of caps on).<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Misc Gameplay Merge.<br>

                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Follower Formula Redone (Relatively devisive mod, companions are now balanced by Player Combat Priority and charisma is now balanced with the bCapSkillsBySPECIAL setting in Tweaks anyways).<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Mobile Truck Base (Didn't really fit the spirit of the guide IMO).<br>
                        <strong>Content:</strong> Added a new Content section, which houses Uncut Wasteland and TLD along with a few new mods.<br>

                        <strong>INI Tweaks:</strong> Set the default value of iNumHWThreads to 2. There is no benefit from setting this higher and it possibly causes issues.<br>
                        <strong>INI Tweaks:</strong> Removed the [Water] INI changes, as I don't think they help performance at all on high-end PCs and they are also the default settings on the High preset and below so lower-end PCs won't be affected.<br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added my own custom INI for NVTF, as the performance INI from the mod page has been removed.

                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Moved JSawyer Ultimate to the <b>Overhauls</b> section. Since it makes the game more difficult by adjusting the default level cap, carry weight, and health formulas, it seems like a better fit. I still would personally use it even on a first-time playthrough, but I received enough complaints for me to move it.

                    <p>
                        <strong>UI:</strong> Removed Consistent Pip-Boy Icons (There is nothing wrong with this mod at all, but VUI+ now includes a remastered version of the interfaceshared0.dds which was the main reason that CPI was included. You should totally keep the mod if you already have it installed, but for simplification purposes, it's being removed. CPI's file size was also about 5x more than the rest of the mods included in the guide).<br>
                        <strong>Resources:</strong> Added guide for generating LOD with FNVLODGen.<br>
                        <strong>Resources:</strong> Added guide for merging mods with FNVEdit.

                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Updated WMIM ESP Replacer to include a vanila copy of the <b>1hpequip.kf</b> file. This makes the WMIM Wrist Fix redundant without causing any addition bugs like the wrist fix did (Since the bug is now fixed on an engine level with JIP LN NVSE).<br>
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Removed WMIM Wrist Fix (See above).<br>

                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Vanilla LOD (Custom mod).<br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added A Little More Lamplight.<br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added New Vegas Redesigned 2 Revised.<br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Separated the Gameplay section into two sections, Gameplay and Overhauls. Gameplay will contain the smaller mods that don't make the game much harder and just add modern QOL features and stuff. The Overhaul section contains the bulk of the difficulty mods like Unfound Loot and Economy Overhaul.<br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added Uncut Wasteland plus NPCs.<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added notes to enable bBarterCheckActorBuySellFlags and bLuckDoesntAffectGambling options in Stewie's Tweaks.<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Complex Vendors.<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Replaced Fallout 3 Economy with Economy Overhaul (Economy Overhaul got updated recently and is back to being my preferred mod).<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Better Character Creation.<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Better Ghouls.<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added The Living Desert (I find it incredibly hard to play without this mod now, the game is just way too empty without it).<br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Mobile Truck Base Remastered.

                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Exchanged Yellow Goodbye for Altitude (Altitude is my new weather mod that I just released, which I believe or not prefer).<br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Simple Interior Lighting Overhaul.<br>
                        <strong>General:</strong> Replaced the home background image with a new screenshot with Altitude. Let me know if you think its kinda hard to read with the white text on the bright lights, its fine for me but I'm sure it varies a lot with monitor settings and all that.

                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added a custom INI for JSUE, which enables the new "Survival Mode" feature and the lowered XP feature among others.<br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed Fallout 4 Survival Mode Damage (The Survival Mode option mentioned above in JSUE does the same thing).<br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added Unfound Loot (Great mod, surprised it took me this long to add it).<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Swapped out OG JSawyer for JSawyer Ultimate Edition (Call it a failed experiment. I originally thought OGSawyer's simplicity would make it easier to work with, but it really isn't much simpler that JSUE overall. Plus it probably lead to many more questions about why the guide uses OG instead of JSUE).<br>
                        <strong>Finish:</strong> Because of the above change, the Conflict Resolution FOMOD isn't needed anymore.

                        <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Swapped out UPNVSE for the new UPNVSE Plus (UPNVSE Plus was specifically made to replace UPNVSE).<br>
                        <strong>Finish:</strong> The load order and conflict resolution have both been updated to reflect the above change.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added New Vegas Heap Replacer to the Utilities section.<br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Changed the installations of the Utilities to manually through MO2 with a note about installing them manually if they don't work when installed through MO2 rather than the other way around (I feel like this was a pretty major source of confusion previously, so hopefully this will clear things up and not totally backfire. Oh and if you already have the utilities installed and working manually, there is no need to change anything).<br>
                        <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Added an ESP replacer for WMIM that strips it down to everything but required texture set/static changes rather than just hiding the ESP (Just hiding the ESP caused visual glitches on a few weapons, this will fix that and is still conflict free).<br>
                        <strong>Whole Guide:</strong> Various instruction improvements since i can never be satisfied.

                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Changed the NVTF instructions to use a raised iMaxFPSTolerance (300), as the automatic FPS tolerance setting has some issues and will most likely be removed soon.
